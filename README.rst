Abstract
########

This will be an introductory lesson to `version control`_ using the widespread distributed version control system `git`_. we will learn enough to use git to control our files in a day-to-day workflow, and  we'll also take a look at `GitHub`_ web service and play around a bit with it.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over
time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows us to do things
as jumping to any moment in a file past history, tracking changes and see differences between any two moments on time, long-term undo, seamlessly collaborate with other people, and many others we'll see...

We will cover topics as:

* Setting up Git and creating a local repository
* Tracking changes and exploring history
* Remotes in GitHub
* Collaborating with other people
* Resolving conflicts
* Contributing to projects
* Git - GitHub - R Studio integration

A short introduction to basic UNIX command line usage will be given, as the
first part of the workshop with be done in the command line.

**Targeted audience**: scientific and technical people interested having a
control over the evolution and history of changes of files and projects they work on, as well as to collaborate with others on a shared repository.

**Content level**: beginner

**Audience prerequisites**: none


Computers setup
###############

This is a hands-on workshop. Participants are encouraged to follow the lesson typing along with the

Your computers should ideally be already configured by the workshop's day. For
this you can follow this `installation instructions`_, "The Bash Shell" and "Git" sections, and ignoring the last Python part if you
want.

.. note::

    We will do some collaborative work using GitHub. In order to follow this
